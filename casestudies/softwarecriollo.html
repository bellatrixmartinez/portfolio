        		<h2> Idea</h2>
        		<p> When we created Software Criollo we wanted to create the best remote based software consulting company. We had the vision back in 2008 of creating the best environment to fully encourage people’s potential to develop their skills in a remote company with world class technology.</p>
            <p>It started with freelance clients my partner and I had. After some time we had too many projects so we hired the first software developer (through an app we had created to generate jobs in Venezuela!). This person brought another friend and after 8 years we were a fully distributed team with more than 20 team members across the globe. Tons of ongoing projects and happy clients.</p>
            <p>Since I was the cofounder of the company it is safe to say I wore many hats :) I was the design lead of the company but also managed most projects and was in charge of building bridges between the design and the development team as well as the clients. I wrote many manuals and strategies to automate and make more efficient our internal business processes.</p>

            <h2>DESIGN. </h2>
            <p> I was the design lead and built a design team of 4 remote designers working full time on our client’s projects. </p>

            <p>I created the brand of the company. Software Criollo means Software that is authentic from the place. The logo was black and white and was a geometric shape that formed the SC of the name of the brand while being a cube that stood together.</p>

            <p>We used the Araguaney picture as the main background of the website since it is very representative of the Venezuelan culture (most of the team was Venezuelan) and for for the projects it meant the flourishing of the idea. The rest of the design was very mono colored sober and flat design. It was important to express our business processes and to give clients confidence and trust.</p>

            <p>The main font we used was Bebas Neue for headings and Roboto in different weights.</p>

            <p> The prototype of the website was done in Sketch and Invision.</p>
