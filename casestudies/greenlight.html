        			<p> Green Light Group is a tour company that offer their services to all major high schools across the United States. </p>
              <p>They sell and manage tours for hundreds of kids at a time. </p>

        		<h2> Brief and Idea.</h2>
        		<p> Green Light Group is an on going client so when they approached me asking to redesign their web presence I was very excited to be part of this because I knew their brand and business well.</p>
            <p>It was very important for them to showcase how fun the trips can be while being extremely safe. Their website needed to showcase the structure of their tour destinations as well as past experiences. Users needed to be able to contact them and as for a quote.</p>
            <p>They already had a web presence and wanted to maintain its core structure for SEO purposes. The website needed to be fully responsive, displaying their content across all devices.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2> WEBSITE DESIGN. </h2>
            <p> Green Light Group Tours is an established brand and they already had logo and colors we needed to work with.</p>
            <p>I created a clean layout using their fun and bold colors. Used Montserrat and its different variants as the font for the website.</p>
            <p>The imagery of the tours needed to be the protagonists of the views so we created big headers using pictures of their past experiences as backgrounds.</p>
            <p>The views of the website design were created using Sketch.</p>

            <h2> IMPLEMENTATION.</h2>
            <p> I created the prototype and collaborated with the client and team using Invision</p>
            <p> One of the main requirements of the project was for the website to have a backend so they could change their content as the company released new tours and destinations. The website was implemented in Wordpress so that they could have this ability.</p>
            <p>They also needed assistance with specifications from design to implementation so that the final product was as close as possible to the inicial UI Mockups. </p>
            <p>The website redesign was a project completed successfully. The client is now able to fully manage its web content and update it periodically. They constantly receive new quotations which have the opportunity to turn into new clients. </p>
